# Bf-Interpreter
Created an interpreter for the esoteric programming language Brainf*** in Python. While the actual language is not censored, I wanted to play it safe. Link to a website that explains Brainf***: https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/

To run:
Two options:
1) Add the code that you would like to run to bf_code.txt and then run the bf_interpreter.py python file.

2) Place a different file that you would like to run into this directory and then change the INSTRUCTIONS_FILE_NAME variable in the constants.py file to the name of intended file. Then run the bf_interpreter.py python file.
